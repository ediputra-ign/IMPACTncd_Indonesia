		# exposure: eg. SBP_curr_xps, 
		# chage: -5 mmHg, 
		# penalty: determines how sharply the penalty increases with x. penalty
		# When penalty = 1, the SBP is simply "reduced at the same rate in proportion to the original SBP,
		# When penalty > 1, the distribution is reduced “more” for larger SBP values and “less” for smaller values.

# The user provides:
#   •	threshold: A numeric value for exposure.
# •	target_prop: The target proportion (0-1) of values exceeding the threshold after applying reduction.
# •	weights: The weights associated with the exposures.
# •	penalty: A penalty parameter, defaulted to 1 (or any desired numeric value).
# 2.	The function calculates the necessary change by using an optimization method (e.g., uniroot) to find the reduction that achieves the desired proportion.
# 3.	After determining the optimal change, apply it to exposures using the proportional logic you previously defined.
